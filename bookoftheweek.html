    <h3> List of the Most Important Characters </h3>
    <dl>
      <dt> Percy Jackson </dt>
      <dd> Percy Jackson is perhaps the best chapter-titler known to man. He is our narrator and the hero of The Lightning Thief. To get a taste of his personality and his sense of humor, just glance at this book's table of contents. Chapter titles like "A God Buys Us Cheeseburgers," and "We Get Advice from a Poodle" really help paint a clear portrait of this twelve-year-old boy and his demi-god sense of humor. </dd>
      <dt> Annabeth Chase </dt>
      <dd> Annabeth is Percy's friend and sometimes competitor. Her mom is Athena, so you can imagine that she is one smart cookie. Thanks to Annabeth, we learn pretty quickly that Athena and Poseidon don't get along very well. Like her mom, Annabeth is really good at strategizing, and she nearly always has a plan. She has been at Camp Half-Blood since she was seven years old. At the age of seven, she ran away from home and linked up with Grover, Luke, and Thalia, making it all the way to Camp Half-Blood safely. She witnessed Thalia's death first-hand. Since then, she has stayed at camp year round. </dd>
      <dt> Grover Underwood </dt>
      <dd> The G-man. Percy's best and only friend in the world. Grover has stuck by Percy throughout sixth grade and has kept watch over him. Percy meets Grover at Yancy Academy and spends much of the time protecting him. According to the Council of Cloven Elders, Grover did not bring Percy safely back to Camp Half-Blood the night the Minotaur attacked – Percy brought him (literally, he carried an unconscious Grover onto camp property). And, in the Council's eyes, Grover also failed to bring Thalia to safety so many summers ago (an event that broke Grover's heart and that weighs on him still). That means that, technically, Grover has failed twice at being a keeper. Grover's last chance to win a searcher's license (so that he can go in search of Pan) is to safely bring Percy and Annabeth home from their quest. </dd>
      <dt> Luke Castellan </dt>
      <dd> Luke is the counselor in Hermes cabin, and he helps Percy a lot in Percy's first days at Camp Half-Blood, showing him the ropes and explaining that everyone at the camp is family. Percy thinks Luke, who is seven years older, is perhaps the coolest guy he's ever met. Gradually, over the course of Percy's time at camp, he realizes that Luke holds a grudge against his own dad, Hermes. Luke does a good job of covering this up, but Percy still observes a strain of sadness in him. </dd>
      <dt> Chiron </dt>
      <dd> Mr. Brunner is Percy's favorite teacher, and teaches Latin. At Yancy Academy, Chiron helps Percy learn about Ancient Greece (the history of the gods and the Titans). On Percy's first day at Camp Half-Blood, he realizes that Mr. Brunner's name is actually Chiron and he has the body of a horse. He helps Mr. D run Camp Half-Blood, training young demi-gods for a life of battling monsters. Chiron tells Percy that he inserted himself at Yancy as a Latin teacher, because he wanted to watch over Percy and because he had a suspicion that Percy was a big deal. Chiron is very wise. His whole job is to help train demi-gods for the work of a hero. He pushes Percy hard in Latin class and beyond, setting high expectations for him. Chiron is also really good at interpreting the Oracle's prophecies, helping Percy understand his own prophecy. </dd>
      <dt> Mr. D </dt>
      <dd> Mr. D is the irritable director of Camp Half-Blood and the God of Wine. His father, Zeus, has sentenced him to centuries of servitude at Camp Half-Blood for bad behavior. Mr. D hates his job and he hates half-bloods. </dd>
      <dt> Sally Jackson </dt>
      <dd> Sally Jackson is Percy's mom. She works at a candy shop in Manhattan and lives in an apartment in Queens, NY with her smelly, mean husband, Gabe. She has a love of life, and she loves her son more than anything else in the world. She doesn't coddle or spoil Percy, though. Sally met Poseidon on Montauk Beach one summer and fell in love. She married Gabe later on primarily because Gabe is smelly, and his stench would protect Percy from monsters. You see, Sally has known all along what being a demi-god will mean for Percy. She is absolutely aware of what the immortal world is like. She tries to protect Percy for as long as possible, but realizes that she must let him go for good to train with other demi-gods. </dd>
    </dl>

    <h4> The Lightning Thief </h4>
    <p> Percy Jackson is a dyslexic twelve-year-old with ADHD. While on a school trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one of the chaperones, Mrs. Dodds, turns into a Fury and attacks him. Percy's favorite teacher, Mr. Brunner, lends Percy a magical sword-pen to defeat her. Percy and his mother Sally go to Long Island. Percy's friend Grover reveals himself as a satyr and warns of danger. At a summer camp, Sally is attacked by a minotaur and disappears in a flash of light. Percy kills the beast with one of its own horns. He learns that the camp is called Camp Half-Blood, and that he is a demigod: the son of a human and a Greek god. He settles into camp life and meets several other demigods, including Luke and Annabeth. After a hellhound attacks him, he is saved by Chiron and then claimed by his father, the god Poseidon. Chiron explains to Percy how the three eldest male gods—Poseidon, Zeus, and Hades—swore an oath not to have children; Percy represents a violation of the oath. He is the second violation of the oath, as the first was Thalia, daughter of Zeus. She was killed by monsters sent by Hades. This, coupled with the fact that Zeus's master lightning bolt has recently been stolen, has bred much suspicion between the gods. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Percy must locate Zeus's lightning bolt. Annabeth and Grover accompany him to the realm of Hades—the most likely culprit. Percy brings Chiron's magic sword Anaklusmos and Luke's flying sneakers. The trio travels to Los Angeles to visit Hades. Along the way, they are attacked by the Furies, Medusa, Echidna, and the Chimera. They perform a favor for the god Ares, who gives them a backpack full of supplies and safe transportation to Nevada. Percy learns more about his companions, his powers, and the world of the Greek gods. In Hades's realm, Grover is nearly dragged into Tartarus by Luke's flying shoes. The battered group finally meets Hades, who reveals that his Helm of Darkness has also been mysteriously stolen, and accuses Percy of stealing it. Hades threatens to kill his hostage Sally and reanimate the dead unless his helm is returned. When Percy finds the missing master bolt inside Ares's backpack, the group realizes they've all been manipulated by Ares. Narrowly escaping the Underworld, Percy challenges Ares to a duel on the beach. After a long and tough fight, Percy wins, and he gives the Helm of Darkness to the Furies. Hades realizes that Percy is not the thief of the helm nor the master bolt, and returns Sally home. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Percy takes the master bolt back to Zeus on Mount Olympus. Percy returns to Camp Half-Blood as a hero and enjoys the rest of his summer. On the last day of camp, however, he goes into the woods with Luke, who reveals himself to be the real thief of Hades's Helm and Zeus's bolt, following the orders of Kronos. Kronos had manipulated the power-hungry Ares into taking part in the scheme. Luke explains his beliefs that the gods are too irresponsible and are poor leaders who need to be overthrown. He offers Percy the chance to join him, and when Percy refuses, Luke tries to kill him with a scorpion. Percy is poisoned and faints. Awakening, he is given the choice of whether to return home for the school year or stay at camp year-round. He decides to spend the school year with his mother, even though it will be more dangerous for him with Luke and Kronos on the loose. Grover and Annabeth also leave the camp for the year but promise to keep in touch with Percy. </p>

    <section id="quoteone"> “In a way, it’s nice to know that there are Greek gods out there because you have somebody to blame when things go wrong. For instance, when you’re walking away from a bus that’s just been attacked by monster hags and blown up by lightning, and it’s raining on top of everything else, most people might think that’s just really bad luck; when you’re a half-blood, you understand that some divine force is really trying to mess up your day.” – Percy Jackson </section>
    <section id="quotetwo"> “I figure the world is basically a machine. I don’t know who made it, if it was the Fates, or the gods, or the capital-G god or whatever. But it chugs along the way it’s supposed to most of the time. Sure, little pieces break off and stuff goes haywire once in a while, but mostly… things happen for a reason.” – Percy Jackson </section>

    <h4> The Sea of Monsters </h4>
    <p> The novel begins with Percy dreaming about Grover being hunted by a monster. He wakes on the last day of his 7th grade year, a peaceful year at Meriwether College Prep. There he has become friends with Tyson, a homeless child that the school has taken on as a form of charity. In gym class, during a game of dodgeball, Percy is attacked by a gang of Laestrygonians, but is saved by Tyson and Annabeth, who was on her way back to Camp Half-Blood after having dreams about the camp in danger. The three take a magical taxi driven by the Graeae to Long Island. Upon reaching the camp, they see a group of campers lead by Clarisse LaRue battling a pair of Colchis bulls. Tyson is granted permission to move past the camp's boundary in order to save Percy once again. It is revealed that he is a baby Cyclops and a half brother of Percy, as he is also a son of Poseidon. An unknown enemy has weakened the protective walls of Camp Half-Blood by poisoning the tree of the demigod Thalia, leaving the campers vulnerable to future monster attacks. Camp counsellor Chiron is accused of poisoning the tree and is fired. Before leaving, Chiron notes that only the Golden Fleece could save the camp. Shortly thereafter, Stymphalian birds attack during the chariot races, but Percy and Annabeth distract them with Chiron's boombox and Dean Martin's "Volare", enabling the Apollo campers to shoot them down. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Due to his charm and skill with a sword, Tantalus becomes the new camp counselor. As a reward for winning the chariot race, Tantalus sends Clarisse LaRue to find the Golden Fleece and forbids anyone else from leaving camp without his permission. After having a talk with the god Hermes about the fate of his son Luke, Percy leaves camp with Annabeth and Tyson to find Grover. With the help of a hippocampus that Tyson names Rainbow, the trio reach the Princess Andromeda, a cruise ship filled with monsters and demigods that have allied with the titan Kronos. On the ship, they are captured by Luke Castellan, and learn that he is working to revive Kronos. The trio narrowly escapes on an emergency lifeboat, and take shelter in a hideout that Annabeth, Thalia, and Luke built as children. There, a hydra finds and attacks them, but they are saved by Clarisse on her ship, the CSS Birmingham. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Annabeth, Percy, and Tyson join Clarisse's quest and journey to the Bermuda Triangle (also known as Sea of Monsters). In order to enter the Sea of Monsters, the ship tries to pass between Charybdis and Scylla, who attack and destroy it. Clarisse gets separated from the others while Tyson is apparently killed in the explosion so Percy and Annabeth board a life boat and head to the nearest island. Like Odysseus, after travelling through the narrow strait that Charybdis and Scylla guarded, the two land on the island of the witch-queen Circe. Realizing that she has turned dozens of men into guinea pigs, they escape on the famous pirate's ship Queen Anne's Revenge which Percy is able to control through just his powers alone while leaving Blackbeard and his crew to deal with Circe. Percy and Annabeth pass the Sirens, and Annabeth confesses her insecurities to Percy. </p>
    <br>
    <p> They reach the island of Percy's half brother, the cyclops Polyphemus where they discover that he has captured Clarisse. Before journeying to the center of the island, Percy and Annabeth meet Grover pretending to be a female cyclops to trick Polyphemus into not eating him. Tyson arrives to help as well, having been rescued by Rainbow from the Birmingham's wreckage. They find the Golden Fleece, but Polyphemus destroys the Queen Anne's Revenge, forcing the group to escape on Rainbow and a few other hippocampus. In Miami, Percy realizes that Clarisse must fly back to camp alone as per her prophecy, but he and the others are captured by Luke. Taken aboard the Princess Andromeda, Percy manages to make contact with Camp Half-Blood through the goddess Iris and tricks Luke into confessing, exonerating Chiron who is reinstated. An enraged Luke battles Percy, but Chiron and several other centaurs known as the Party Ponies arrive to rescue them and Chiron explains that he is mistrusted as Kronos is his father. </p>
    <br>
    <p> The Golden Fleece is hung on Thalia's pine tree, and the tree is cured. Grover is given a furlough on his personal quest to find the god Pan, having cleared the obstacle of Polyphemus luring in searchers through the Golden Fleece. The camp holds a second chariot race which Percy and Annabeth win with the help of Tyson who departs after accepting an offer from Poseidon to work in the god's underwater Cyclops forges. However, the Fleece's magic is too strong and it resurrects Thalia, providing another possible demigod for the Great Prophecy which Percy realizes was Kronos' intention all along. </p>

    <br>
    
    <h4> The Titans Curse </h4>
    <p> Percy Jackson, Annabeth Chase, and Thalia Grace get a ride from Sally Jackson to Westover Hall, a boarding school in Bar Harbor, Maine, to escort two sibling half-bloods named Nico and Bianca di Angelo to Camp Half-Blood. They are attacked by a teacher named Dr. Thorn, who is actually a manticore. Though the goddess Artemis and her hunters arrive to help, Dr. Thorn jumps off a cliff with Annabeth on his back. Artemis is troubled by the manticore's mention of a "Great Stirring" of monsters, and goes off alone to hunt an Olympus-destroying monster she believes to have finally returned from Tartarus. She sends the half-bloods and Hunters (whose numbers now include Bianca di Angelo, after she takes their oath) to Camp Half-Blood with her brother Apollo on his solar chariot. </p>
    <br>
    <p> At camp, Percy and Blackjack, his pegasus friend, save a sea monster that Percy nicknames Bessie, and Artemis's lieutenant Zoë Nightshade begins having mysterious dreams about Artemis in grave danger. Percy has dreams about Annabeth saving Luke from being crushed by the ceiling of a <img id="titansone" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSlQHuE9r93AKr8TP1N57Ctl2wrsHlKchtKXA&usqp=CAU"> cave and holding it up for him. Both Zoë and Percy are unable to act until the Oracle (an old mummy) somehow leaves the attic in the Big House by itself, during a capture the flag game in which Thalia and Percy almost get into a physical confrontation. After it delivers a prophecy to Zoë, she and Chiron organize a quest, and she decides to bring Thalia, Grover Underwood, Bianca, and another Hunter with her (who is then taken out of commission by a deadly prank). Percy is forbidden from going because the Hunters refuse to travel or associate with a male, due to their chastity vows. Before leaving, he meets up with Nico, to whom he promises to keep Bianca safe during the quest. He successfully sneaks away from camp on Blackjack and follows the group, though he is almost stopped by Mr. D while on the Chrysler Building, who only agrees to let him go because there is a high chance Percy will be killed while on the quest. </p>
    <br>
    <p> When he arrives in Washington, D.C., Percy notices Dr. Thorn heading into the National Museum of Natural History and follows him using Annabeth's invisibility hat. Luke Castellan and a large man called the General are there, and together they summon spartoi, undead skeleton warriors, to hunt the official quest group, who are nearby in the National Air and Space Museum. Percy tries to warn the group, but they are attacked by the Nemean lion before they can leave. They fight the lion and manage to kill it, with Percy taking its impenetrable pelt as a spoil of war. The quest group and Percy flee, and, on the advice of Apollo (in disguise as a homeless man), travel to Cloudcroft, New Mexico by freighthopping. In Cloudcroft, Grover senses the presence of the god Pan, who sends the Erymanthian boar to help them escape the spartoi. The boar carries them as far as Gila Claw, Arizona, where the "Junkyard of the Gods" lies. After a brief encounter with Ares and Aphrodite (in which Aphrodite analyzes Percy's attraction to Annabeth, but also warns him of the dangers of the Junkyard), the group enters the junkyard, where Bianca tries to take a cursed statuette for Nico. Her theft awakens a prototype of Talos, and she gives her life to bring it down. The remaining quest members sullenly travel to Hoover Dam after stealing boats. There, Percy meets a mortal girl who can see through the Mist named Rachel Elizabeth Dare, and with the help of Athena (in disguise as a tour guide), the quest members narrowly escape the spartoi again, arriving in San Francisco on the backs of two bronze flying angels. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Once there, Percy seeks out Nereus and learns that the monster Artemis was hunting is Bessie, the monster he saved back at camp with Blackjack, who is an ophiotaurus (a creature whose entrails can be burned to acquire the power to destroy Olympus). Using this fact, Luke attempts to coax Thalia into joining the side of the Titans, as she is almost 16 and appears to be the hero of the Great Prophecy, and she hesitantly refuses. After a final encounter with Dr. Thorn, in which Percy pleads with Mr. D to help him defeat the manticore, Grover heads back to Camp Half-Blood with Bessie, with Percy offering the Nemean lion's pelt as tribute to Poseidon for their safe journey. Zoë, Percy, and Thalia go to find Frederick Chase, Annabeth's father and a plane pilot, in the hope that he will help them reach their final destination: Mount Tamalpais, the modern location of the Titans' fortress on Mount Othrys. In Professor Chase's car, they travel to the Garden of the Hesperides. After confronting the Hesperides (whom Zoë is an exiled member of, due to her helping Heracles steal a golden apple during the Labours of Hercules by gifting him Riptide, Percy's sword), Zoë is <img id="titanstwo" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f2/b5/cd/f2b5cd85bfb809e4303e61926ccb69ea.jpg">wounded by the poison of the dragon Ladon while they pass through. At the place where the Titan Atlas once held up the sky, the group finds Artemis now doing his job. After seeing Annabeth tied up and held hostage by Luke, and learning that "the General" is not only Atlas, but Zoë's father, Percy briefly takes the sky's weight from Artemis so she can fight against the Titan. Artemis engages Atlas, and is able to trap him under the sky again with the help of Percy, but not before he seriously wounds Zoë by pushing her off of a cliff. Thalia battles Luke, and is kicked off the side of the mountain by her, apparently dead. With the help of Mr. Chase, who arrives in a biplane he has fitted with machine guns that fire celestial bronze bullets, they escape and travel to a nearby airfield in Artemis' silver chariot. Zoë dies from her injuries shortly after landing, and Artemis makes a new constellation in her honor. The rest of the group then head for Mount Olympus. </p>
    <br>
    <p> During the winter solstice meeting, the gods are finally convinced by Artemis to take action against the Titans. Thalia is also asked by Artemis to become an immortal Huntress, and she accepts, delaying the onset of the Great Prophecy by keeping her forever 15 years old. Percy is told by his father, Poseidon, that Luke is miraculously alive. Athena warns Percy to stay away from Annabeth. The two return to Camp Half-Blood, skeptical and worried about the future. Before Percy is able to go home, however, Percy is forced to explain Bianca's death to Nico. Nico immediately blames Percy, as Percy promised to keep her safe. When a group of spartoi arrive to attack Percy, Nico banishes them to the underworld, revealing himself as a son of Hades. Shortly after, Nico runs away from camp, and Percy tells the truth of Nico's parentage to Annabeth and Grover. They promise to hide the fact from everyone else, especially the Titans' army, because this means that there are once again two possible heroes for the Great Prophecy. </p>
    
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    <h4> The Battle of the Labyrinth </h4>
    <p> Percy Jackson attends freshman orientation at Goode High School, where he sees Rachel Elizabeth Dare, a mortal who can see through the Mist. She helps him fight two empousai and escape. Percy travels to Camp Half-Blood, where he learns Grover is in trouble with the Council of Cloven Elders for not having found Pan. During a competition organized by the new sword instructor Quintus, Annabeth and Percy accidentally find an entrance into the Labyrinth, which presents a possible invasion route for Luke. Annabeth is given leadership of a quest to find Daedalus and convince the inventor not to give Luke Ariadne's string, which would help him navigate the Labyrinth. She chooses Grover, Percy, and Tyson to accompany her. Before leaving, Percy learns that Nico plans to bring back his late sister (with help from King Minos) by exchanging her soul for someone who has cheated death – like Percy. In the maze, the questers face a number of trials including meeting Briares, the Sphinx, and Janus, before arriving at the ranch of Geryon and meeting Nico. They seek out Hephaestus, and after speaking to him they part ways; Tyson and Grover search for Pan, while Annabeth and Percy go to the god's forge in the volcano Mount St. Helens. </p>
    <br>
    <p> In the forge, Percy is almost killed by Kronos's smiths, but escapes by causing an earthquake that ejects him from the volcano. When Percy awakens, he finds himself on the island Ogygia with Calypso, a daughter of the Titan Atlas. Calypso tells Percy she is cursed to fall in love with every hero that lands on her island, but the hero can never stay. After Hephaestus tells him of events in the mortal world, Percy realizes that he too must leave. Back at Camp Half-Blood, Percy and Annabeth go <img id="labyrinthone" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/bf/PercyBattleLabyrinth.jpg/250px-PercyBattleLabyrinth.jpg"> to Manhattan to find Rachel, who should be able to navigate the Labyrinth. Despite being captured by Luke's minions, they eventually reach Daedalus's workshop and learn Quintus is actually the ancient inventor, living as an automaton. He informs them that, believing they could not withstand a Titan assault, he has already helped Luke. The group is discovered by Luke, who tells them Minos has been planning to exchange Daedalus's soul for his own. The four teenagers fight to escape while the betrayed Daedalus remains in the maze with his hellhound. </p>
    <br>
    <p> The quartet later discover the Titan fortress at Mount Othrys, and learn that Luke has been somehow possessed by Kronos. They run into Grover and Tyson, and discover the resting place of Pan, who speaks to them and passes part of his fading spirit into each of them. The group, minus Rachel, then heads back to Camp Half-Blood to fight. The Titan army floods out of the Labyrinth and appears to be winning until Daedalus arrives with Mrs. O’Leary and Briares, who kills Kampê. Grover scares off the remaining Titan forces by causing a Panic. After the battle, Nico helps Daedalus pass on, destroying the Labyrinth. After a memorial service for the dead campers, Percy leaves camp for the school year. On his fifteenth birthday at summer's end, Percy receives a visit from his father Poseidon, who gives him a sand dollar, advising him to "spend it wisely". Nico later appears to tell Percy his plan to defeat Luke once and for all. </p>
    
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    <h4> The Last Olympian </h4>
    <p> While Percy Jackson is on a drive with Rachel Dare, he is approached by Charles Beckendorf, and the two head off to attack Luke's ship, The Princess Andromeda. Kronos, hosted in the mortal body of Luke, is not caught off guard because of a spy at Camp Half-Blood, and Beckendorf is killed in an explosion. Percy awakens later in his father Poseidon's underwater palace, which is under siege by the Titan Oceanus. Percy wants to help fight, but Poseidon sends Percy back to Camp Half-Blood to hear the "Great Prophecy." Once there, Percy informs the camp of the spy and learns that the Olympians are fighting Typhon. That night, Percy leaves with Nico di Angelo, son of Hades, following a lead on how to defeat Kronos. After visiting Luke's mother in Westport, Connecticut, and talking with Hestia, Percy procures a blessing from his mother. He then descends into the underworld to bathe in the River Styx and take on the curse of Achilles. Despite being betrayed by Nico in exchange for information on the boy's mother, Percy is successful and uses his new invulnerability to defeat a small army of Hades's minions. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Percy emerges from the Underworld in New York City, leaving Nico behind to convince his father to join the fight against Kronos. Percy calls the campers to help defend Olympus, as the gods refuse to end their struggle with Typhon. Just before the battle begins, New York City is affected by a powerful sleeping spell from Morpheus, Hecate, and Kronos himself. Despite being joined by Thalia's Hunters of Artemis, the Party Ponies, and a few other allies, the Olympian army struggles to hold back repeated assaults by the Titan army. Camp Half-Blood suffers approximately 16 casualties, out of an original 40 campers. Annabeth herself is badly injured when she saves Percy from an attack by Ethan Nakamura that would have hit Percy in his Achilles point. Even after these setbacks, Percy refuses a chance to surrender offered by Prometheus, and entrusts the Titan's gift of Pandora's <img id="olympianone" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSUa8R0EsB0_vm4BQgm-cPRiJ0QMMDtzD2ZzA&usqp=CAU"> pithos to Hestia. The campers successfully defeat Hyperion, further enraging Kronos. Rachel Dare, who has been experiencing inexplicable moments of prophecy, arrives to warn Percy of a drakon that can only be killed by a child of Ares. The campers do poorly against the drakon until Silena Beauregard arrives disguised as Ares's head counselor Clarisse and breaks the cabin's boycott of the war, getting badly injured in the process. The real Clarisse arrives in a fury and kills the drakon by herself. As Silena lies dying, the campers learn that she was the camp's spy, but chose to right her wrongs after her boyfriend Beckendorf's death. </p>

    <p> Percy contacts his father and asks Poseidon to join the fight against Typhon; he reluctantly agrees. Driven back to the blocks surrounding the Empire State Building, Percy and his friends make their last stand to protect Mount Olympus. Even when Hades arrives with Nico and an army, Kronos still manages to enter Olympus. Percy attacks Kronos, without either side gaining a significant advantage. In an Iris message-vision, the combatants are able to see Typhon approaching New York, only to be defeated with the aid of Poseidon and his cyclopes. Ethan Nakamura also rebels against Kronos's expectations but is killed. When Kronos attacks Annabeth, Luke is able to regain control of his body and, with Percy's help, he injures himself at his mortal point and apparently kills Kronos. As he dies, Luke tells Percy that Ethan had the right idea; the war was caused by the resentment of unrecognized gods and unclaimed children. He dies peacefully, and the Fates themselves carry his body away. </p>

    <p> The gods grant rewards to several heroes who were instrumental in defeating the Titans, including Thalia, Grover, Annabeth, Tyson, Clarisse, and Nico. Finally, Percy is called forward. Zeus offers him the greatest gift of all time: immortal godhood. Much to the Olympians' shock, Percy instead asks the gods to swear on the River Styx that they will claim all demigods by the time they turn thirteen, have cabins built for the children of all minor gods and Hades, and give amnesty to innocent Titans and their former allies such as Calypso. Percy also relieves Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades of their oath to not have demigod children. Privately, Hermes reveals to Percy that Kronos is not dead, but is instead hopefully spread so thin that he can never form a consciousness again let alone a body as the Titans cannot die any more than the gods can. After the meeting, Percy discovers Rachel plans to become the new Oracle, and he rushes to camp with Annabeth and Nico. With Apollo's supervision, Rachel safely becomes the new Oracle and speaks the next Great Prophecy. The novel ends shortly after Annabeth celebrates Percy's birthday and the two begin dating. The gods are keeping to their new promises, and Camp Half-Blood is slowly returning to normal. The many fallen demigods are honored with the end-of-summer's bead. </p>
