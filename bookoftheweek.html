    <h3> List of the Most Important Characters </h3>
    <dl>
      <dt> Percy Jackson </dt>
      <dd> Percy Jackson is perhaps the best chapter-titler known to man. He is our narrator and the hero of The Lightning Thief. To get a taste of his personality and his sense of humor, just glance at this book's table of contents. Chapter titles like "A God Buys Us Cheeseburgers," and "We Get Advice from a Poodle" really help paint a clear portrait of this twelve-year-old boy and his demi-god sense of humor. </dd>
      <dt> Annabeth Chase </dt>
      <dd> Annabeth is Percy's friend and sometimes competitor. Her mom is Athena, so you can imagine that she is one smart cookie. Thanks to Annabeth, we learn pretty quickly that Athena and Poseidon don't get along very well. Like her mom, Annabeth is really good at strategizing, and she nearly always has a plan. She has been at Camp Half-Blood since she was seven years old. At the age of seven, she ran away from home and linked up with Grover, Luke, and Thalia, making it all the way to Camp Half-Blood safely. She witnessed Thalia's death first-hand. Since then, she has stayed at camp year round. </dd>
      <dt> Grover Underwood </dt>
      <dd> The G-man. Percy's best and only friend in the world. Grover has stuck by Percy throughout sixth grade and has kept watch over him. Percy meets Grover at Yancy Academy and spends much of the time protecting him. According to the Council of Cloven Elders, Grover did not bring Percy safely back to Camp Half-Blood the night the Minotaur attacked â€“ Percy brought him (literally, he carried an unconscious Grover onto camp property). And, in the Council's eyes, Grover also failed to bring Thalia to safety so many summers ago (an event that broke Grover's heart and that weighs on him still). That means that, technically, Grover has failed twice at being a keeper. Grover's last chance to win a searcher's license (so that he can go in search of Pan) is to safely bring Percy and Annabeth home from their quest. </dd>
      <dt> Luke Castellan </dt>
      <dd> Luke is the counselor in Hermes cabin, and he helps Percy a lot in Percy's first days at Camp Half-Blood, showing him the ropes and explaining that everyone at the camp is family. Percy thinks Luke, who is seven years older, is perhaps the coolest guy he's ever met. Gradually, over the course of Percy's time at camp, he realizes that Luke holds a grudge against his own dad, Hermes. Luke does a good job of covering this up, but Percy still observes a strain of sadness in him. </dd>
      <dt> Chiron </dt>
      <dd> Mr. Brunner is Percy's favorite teacher, and teaches Latin. At Yancy Academy, Chiron helps Percy learn about Ancient Greece (the history of the gods and the Titans). On Percy's first day at Camp Half-Blood, he realizes that Mr. Brunner's name is actually Chiron and he has the body of a horse. He helps Mr. D run Camp Half-Blood, training young demi-gods for a life of battling monsters. Chiron tells Percy that he inserted himself at Yancy as a Latin teacher, because he wanted to watch over Percy and because he had a suspicion that Percy was a big deal. Chiron is very wise. His whole job is to help train demi-gods for the work of a hero. He pushes Percy hard in Latin class and beyond, setting high expectations for him. Chiron is also really good at interpreting the Oracle's prophecies, helping Percy understand his own prophecy. </dd>
      <dt> Mr. D </dt>
      <dd> Mr. D is the irritable director of Camp Half-Blood and the God of Wine. His father, Zeus, has sentenced him to centuries of servitude at Camp Half-Blood for bad behavior. Mr. D hates his job and he hates half-bloods. </dd>
      <dt> Sally Jackson </dt>
      <dd> Sally Jackson is Percy's mom. She works at a candy shop in Manhattan and lives in an apartment in Queens, NY with her smelly, mean husband, Gabe. She has a love of life, and she loves her son more than anything else in the world. She doesn't coddle or spoil Percy, though. Sally met Poseidon on Montauk Beach one summer and fell in love. She married Gabe later on primarily because Gabe is smelly, and his stench would protect Percy from monsters. You see, Sally has known all along what being a demi-god will mean for Percy. She is absolutely aware of what the immortal world is like. She tries to protect Percy for as long as possible, but realizes that she must let him go for good to train with other demi-gods. </dd>
